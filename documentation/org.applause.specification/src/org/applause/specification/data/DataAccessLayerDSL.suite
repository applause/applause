#Data Access Layer DSL

The data access layer DSL in Applause is a domain specific language that allows you to describe data and how to access it. In particular, it supports:

* specifying basic datatypes and mapping them to their respective counterparts in the languages used to build native apps
* using those datatypes to define entities and their properties
* specifying remote datasource
* specifying datasources
* defining local filters

##Describing Data

- "Scalar Data Types": make up the core of the Applause DSLs, they are one of the building blocks for the other concepts used throughout the DSL. 
- "Entities": are used to model data structures that you pass between a backend and your app

##Describing Data Access

* remote data access
* local data access
